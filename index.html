		<p>
			The overarching goal of the Santos Family Foundation is to decrease fatalities due to motor vehicle collisions. The Summer Team's task was to translate this goal into a Senior Capstone Project (SCOPE) at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. Our results include four project ideas, and a careful documentation of how we approached this open-ended space. We want the SCOPE team to design for drivers from the bottom-up, and for their creations to spark greater action from drivers, government, and the auto industry.
