		We worked with a wide range of individuals who affect the automotive field. The researchers, first responders, transportation attorneys, driving simulators, urban roadway policy-makers, and higher-ups of important vehicle manufacturers gave us key insights which really guided our process. key insights from these interviews, and they guided much of our process.

		<h4>WHAT: The Current State of Auto Safety</h4>
		<p>In 2012, motor vehicle collisions caused 33,561 fatalities in the United States, and were the leading cause of death in people aged 6-35. As a culture, we accept their inevitability. Even the language surrounding crashes- "accidents" -speaks to our society's comfort with their presence.
		</p>
		<p>As a team, we disagree with this phenomenon. In order to combat it, we started by understanding the current situation.
		</p>
		<h4>WHEN and WHERE: Situations</h4>
		<p>We started by exploring <strong>SITUATIONS</strong> which are, statistically, more dangerous.
		</p>
		<h4>WHY: Driver States</h4>
		<p>From these <strong>SITUATIONS</strong>, we considered what might be at play. Clearly, situations with high traffic volume, such as rush hour and urban intersections, were more likely to result in collisions. 
		</p>
		<p>Additionally, holidays were the most dangerous individual days of the year. Data from these times show that not only are more people on the roads, but there is statistically much more alcohol at play. This may also speak to why the hours between midnight and 4 AM were the most dangerous. 
		</p>
		<p>But exactly what <strong>DRIVER STATES</strong> result in more dangerous driving? Substances like alcohol, marijuana, and prescription medications topped our list, but we also looked into substance free STATES: boredom, fatigue, lack of engagement with the road, stress, and the uncertainty of travelling unfamiliar roads.
		</p>
		<h4>WHO: Everyone</h4>
		<p>Though certain demographics of drivers are more likely to be involved in the above situations, (for example, parents are often distracted by their multiple passengers,) we found that the DIRECT CAUSES were a stronger indicator of accidents.
		</p>
		<h4>HOW: Direct Causes</h4>
		<p>The links between unsafe <strong>DRIVER STATES</strong> and <strong>SITUATIONS</strong> where collisions and deaths actually occur, of course, are the <strong>DIRECT CAUSES</strong>. Basically, these are the dangerous behaviors promoted by impaired, disengaged and distracted driving and include: increased response time, thwarted expectations, speeding, underestimating the danger of obstacles, and decreased visibility. Basically, we want to reduce the effects of the affected DRIVER STATES, which occur with frequency even as you drive mostly unimpaired.
		</p>
		<p>We then looked at how individuals are introduced to driving. We learn how to interact with the road long before we reach driving age, and everything we learn and do could have implications in our safety. We lay these out in order to consider where to focus our efforts.
		</p>
		<p>However, though there are many constraints of our project. We are a 1-3 year senior engineering project, with a limited budget. Perhaps cultural or educational materials will not create as engineering focused. Additionally, our limited resources would not allow us to influence crash mitigation technology, because hugely expensive projects by vehicle manufacturers with decades of experience are unlikely to have missed any low-hanging fruit.
		</p>
		<p>We therefore decided to focus our efforts on in-the-moment prevention for drivers. As we outlined in the HOW section above, the <strong>DIRECT CAUSES</strong> of accidents can occur no matter what when and who is driving. Therefore, we want to encourage drivers in any DRIVER STATE to obey traffic laws, respond to hazards quickly, and make the correct judgment.
		</p>
		
		<h3>"The best technologies are those that empower people."</h3>
		<p><strong></strong>Cody, motorcycle designer and bike enthusiast</strong> </p>

		<p>In working with the <a href='http://fdnweb.org/santos/'>Santos Family Foundation</a>, a goal of our project is to have an impact on the auto world from the bottom-up. If we create a demand for a product which improves safety, then the automobile makers will respond accordingly.
		</p>
		<p>Our team ideated wildly, drew up sketches for our favorite ideas, then brought these more fleshed out project ideas back to drivers. We worked with drivers of all ages, who drive all sorts of cars, and who drive distances ranging from under 10 miles per week to over 200. By observing their driving habits and sharing our ideas, we were able to narrow and converge about 20 ideas down to four key <strong>PROJECT IDEAS</strong>.
